# IS537_Final_Project

This repository contains the final project for IS537: Data Cleaning and Data Quality.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between BWF player world rankings and national average win rates. The goal is to evaluate data quality, identify inconsistencies, and clean and integrate two real-world datasets to support analysis.

## 🔍 Research Question

**To what extent does a badminton player's world ranking correlate with their national win rate?**

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `IS537_Final_Notebook.ipynb` – The final Jupyter Notebook with code, cleaning steps, and visualizations.
- `data/` – Raw datasets used in the project.
- `processed/` – Cleaned and merged datasets.
- `results/` – Output visualizations and final data exports (optional).
- `.gitignore` – Excludes unnecessary files from the repo (e.g., `.ipynb_checkpoints/`).
- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions.

## 📊 Datasets Used

- Flashscore Player Rankings Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jatinthakur706/top-100-badminton-players
- BWF Super Series Match Results (2015–2017) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/canggih/badminton-game-data-bwf-super-series-20152017

## 🛠 Key Cleaning Steps

- Standardization of country names
- Merge conflict resolution
- Outlier detection
- Constraint checking on match type
- Deduplication
- Final profiling and visualization

## 🔗 Final Report

You can find the final PDF report in the repository **(uploaded separately)** or by request. All code and cleaning steps are documented in the notebook.

## 📎 Reproducibility

- All analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook.
- File organization followed a clear structure (`data/`, `processed/`, `results/`).
- GitHub version control ensures transparency and reproducibility.
